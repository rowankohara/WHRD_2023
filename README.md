Interpersonal violence (IPV) exposure increases the risk for major depression and alcohol use disorder (AUD). 
The purpose of this study was to examine phenotypic associations between IPV exposure and symptoms of depression and AUD and if these associations vary between sexes in a college-age sample. Data were from the Spit for Science project collected from college students (N = 7,561, 64% female). 
Participants self-reported IPV exposure (experiencing physical or sexual assault prior to starting college), depression symptoms (4-item abbreviated Symptoms Checklist-90 for previous 30 days), and AUD symptoms (11-item DSM-5 criteria for the last year). 
Mean depression symptom scores were significantly higher in females than males (9.52 vs. 8.22, t = 14.51, p = 6.17 × 10<sup>-33</sup>) as well as the IPV exposure rate (42% vs. 32%, p = 2.68 × 10<sup>-17</sup>). These results support the greater risk and prevalence of major depression and IPV exposure in women. 
However, there was no difference in the rate of AUD between the sexes (31% vs. 31%, p = 0.53), lending evidence to the decreasing gap in negative alcohol phenotypes between the sexes. 
In a multiple logistic regression model, IPV exposure (p = 2.70 × 10<sup>−20</sup>) and depression symptom scores (p = 4.85 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) were statistically significant and positively predicted AUD, while sex was not statistically significant. 
Further investigation into the increase in negative alcohol phenotypes among females is needed to inform prevention and treatment options.
